    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I am Yijun Zhou, a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Information Science from the University of Pittsburgh. Currently, I am serving as a Research Associate & Software Engineer in the Department of Bioinformatics at UPITT.</p>

    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>Master of Science, Information Science - University of Pittsburgh (2021-2023)</p>
    <p>Bachelar of Science, Intelligent Science and Technology - Dalian Maritime University (2017-2021)</p>

    <h1>Work experience</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Research Assistant - Department of Bio-informatics, UPITT</h3>
            <p>Sep 2022 - Now</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFNN) using TensorFlow to predict later occurrences of breast cancer metastasis, achieving a maximum test AUC of 0.8 and above.</li>
                <li>Introduced Single Hyperparameter Grid Search (SHGS) and Random Hyperparameter Grid Search (RHGS) techniques to overcome traditional grid search limitations, enhancing exploration of the solution space. Currently documenting findings for submission to a medical journal.</li>
                <li>Implemented a transformer model and fine-tuned both Bert and GPT models for a prediction task. Achieved respective improvements of 2.3%, 4.9%, and 3.3% compared to the DFNN model, 2.2%, 4.7%, and 3.1% compared to the basic BERT model, and 2.1%, 4.6%, and 3.0% compared to the basic GPT model.</li>
                <li>Independently developed a data visualization application that incorporates statistical analyses and figure plotting using Python, Flask, MongoDB, and various AWS technologies such as Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, S3, CodePipeline, etc. Serving as a no-code online data analytics platform, which significantly facilitates the data analysis process for non-computer professionals.</li>
                <li>Contributed to the development of a model-assisted medical diagnosis application that integrates the use of a pre-trained DFNN model for prediction using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, etc. Users can also perform online training/testing of the model.</li>
                <li>Called the GPT API and created a virtual assistant using the prompt method to facilitate user interaction. Simultaneously, constructed a question-and-answer cache library based on similarity calculations, resulting in a reducing the number of API calls to minimize costs.</li>
                <li>Responsible for deploying and maintaining all web applications within the lab on AWS. Primary duties include but are not limited to, using SSL to secure all web applications, utilizing Secret Manager and S3 for storing sensitive information, as well as monitoring and analyzing application performance with CloudWatch.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Product Assistant(Intern) - Shangben Big Data company</h3>
            <p>July 2020 - Aug 2020</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contributed to an intelligent transportation project in Minhang District, Shanghai, China</li>
                <li>Participated in improving a reinforced learning model to enhance our traffic light control system, reducing
instances of unnecessary green light cycles, and minimizing waiting times of 0.52s for traffic flow.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
